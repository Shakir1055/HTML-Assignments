    <h1>Garlic Naan</h1>
    <p>This flavorful garlic naan bread is cooked on the stovetop, in a cast-iron skillet. It makes a wonderful accompaniment to your favorite Indian dish.
        Though we most often associate naan with Indian cuisine, versions of it are prepared throughout Asia. In fact, naan is simply the Persian word for bread, and in Iran, it's a generic term that doesn't correlate with any specific style. Elsewhere, naan is a leavened flatbread typically baked in a tandoori oven, which reaches upwards of 900Â°F to result in the bread's signature charred brown spots and gentle puff.
        
        Happily, restaurant-quality naan can easily be replicated at home on the stovetop with the aid of a cast-iron skillet. Cast iron works because it's capable of getting very hot and retaining that heat. When it comes to shaping your naan, you can certainly use a rolling pin to flatten the dough, but hand-stretching helps preserve some of the air pockets to form the bread's pillowy bubbles.
        This garlic naan recipe calls for butter to brush over the finished naan, but ghee is the traditional choice if you happen to have some on hand. For extra flavor, feel free to top the bread with chopped cilantro along with the garlic.</p>
