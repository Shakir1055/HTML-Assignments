    <h1>Chicken Bihari Kabab</h1>
    <p>A Pakistani BBQ delicacy, Bihari Kabab are thin strips of beef marinated in a spicy homemade masala and finished off with coal smoke. Traditionally they are grilled over charcoal but to make it easy for everyone in this recipe they are cooked in a pan.

        Bihari Kabab is originally from Bihar, India and now is also a popular BBQ item in Pakistan. They are spicy, very tender pieces of beef that are barbecued on a charcoal grill.
        
        These thin strips of beef are marinated with a meat tenderizer for absolute softness, yogurt, fried onions and a bold seasoning mix that adds spice and flavour and finished off with mustard oil which is an integral part of their flavouring.</p>
