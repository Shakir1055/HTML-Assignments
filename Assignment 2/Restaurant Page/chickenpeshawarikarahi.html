    <h1>Chicken Peshawari Karahi</h1>
    <p>Peshawari chicken karahi is a specialty of Peshawar. Made with no onions, this chicken karahi recipe has a tomato masala base packed with flavours and juicy chicken. Serve this authentic chicken karahi recipe with a side of naan for a delightful dinner!
        
       Karahis are a popular curry all over Pakistan and India gaining increasing popularity in restaurants all over the globe. Nothing gives Indian flavours quite as karahis do. I love my karahis whether it’s a lamb karahi or chicken karahi.
       
       If you haven’t heard of karahis then you are definitely missing out. Juicy, tender pieces of chicken simmered in a beautiful tomato masala. The tomatoes are the star of this dish, so make sure you use good quality tomatoes.
       
       However, with that being said often good quality ingredients are hard to come by so even if you use any old tomato then this chicken karahi is bound to taste good. Just need to use A LOT of them!</p>
