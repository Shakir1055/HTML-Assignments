    <h1>SeaFood Chowder Soup</h1>
    <p>A variety of different seafoods and vegetables cooked in a milk base to create a rich and hearty soup. A Seafood Chowder may contain an abundance of shellfish mixed with other fish or simply be all shellfish, depending on the recipe, the chef and the region in which the Chowder is being made. Seafood Chowders will often have a greater amount of local fish and shellfish if made close to an area where the meat can be purchased or caught. However, all traditional chowders will contain a larger proportion of solid ingredients to liquid ingredients.
        Some of the common ingredients in a Seafood Chowder may include clam broth, potatoes, clams, shrimp, fish, celery, butter, milk or cream, sweet peppers, onions, herbs, spices, and flavorings. Russet potatoes are most often used as a thickener for Seafood Chowders since they contain higher levels of starch but are low in moisture content. As an alternative, a roux can also be used to thicken this type of soup. Seafood Chowders will vary in flavor and ingredients throughout the world, but regardless of where the Chowder is made, it most often provides a savory mixture of seafoods that are very rich in flavor.</p>
